# Personal Spend Analysis
## Introduction
In this Project i have collated the data of my past 4 years bank transactions, i tried to find as many insights from the data as possible.
However, it was easy to understand the data as i was the only one who was tracking this data from all those years but it could still lead to some trends or hidden costs which might lead to a better spend structure or just a personal feedback.
Below here, i have given the public tableau link for final Visualization of my completed project.

## About the project
I have performed data analysis steps to determine the significant trends in the spend structure. The data used was personal so it couldn't be shared publicly,
apart from that it will not exploit any privacy. 

## Steps for analysis
## Ask - (asking analytical questions)
1. What was the yearly trend of bank balance in past 4 years.
2. Who was the person/receiver/sender to whom i have been transacting the most.
3. Where do most of the money gets spends on.

## Prepare 
Collated past 4 years (2019 july to 2023 july) of bank statement and combined it into a single excel file. It was a personal data having transaction ids and names of the people with transaction dates. There were 4 different files for each year so i combined it onto a single excel file.

## Process
Here i have used excel because i was dealing with a smaller dataset which can be cleaned or combined into excel. SQL is also used in some cases where excel commands were inefficient to perform.

## Data Cleaning
First and foremost , the data has to be unbiased and free of errors. Therefore i started cleaning onto excel itself. 
Filters and sorting functions helped a lot to remove any 'blanks' and null values. However, the data was from bank with proper columns and rows so the margin of error was minimum.

## Data Exploration
Here MySQL was used to perform many commands on a record of around 1500+ rows.
